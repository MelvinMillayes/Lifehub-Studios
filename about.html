                    <p>Combining the facets of wellness and health management into a single, accessible platform,
                        LifeHUB was
                        created to share enriching membership experiences around all aspects of wellness - physical,
                        mental, social,
                        educational and creative.</p>

                    <p>Starting with a robust physical fitness live class schedule and library of on-demand programming,
                        working
                        off the foundation of fitness programming developed by Technogym, LifeHUB is much more than a
                        physical
                        wellness portal.</p>

                    <p>LifeHUB is the place for people to gather to build on their wellness journey - going beyond
                        physical fitness
                        options to include personal and professional development programs; creative studios that explore
                        art, music,
                        cooking, etc.; and conversation groups where guided interactions and experiences can be shared
                        to advance
                        social and cultural wellness dialog.</p>

                    <p>The LifeHUB model starts virtual, with access to the LifeHUB app where members access a full
                        library of live
                        and on-demand LifeHUB Studios experiences. Custom classes and specialized community studios can
                        be created to
                        meet more specialized community needs - for employers, dispersed organizations, and campus
                        environments
                        desiring wellness-focused interactions for their people.</p>

                    <p>Through on demand and live experiences, personal coaching and interaction, LifeHUB is a wellness
                        community
                        platform to enrich members' lives.</p>

                    <p>With physical fitness and engagement the foundation of a healthy lifestyle, the LifeHUB
                        development team
                        includes a physical therapy and rehabilitation expert; a developer and visionary who has spent
                        decades creating
                        compelling community centers; education, lifestyle and engagement leaders; and skilled
                        technology professionals
                        from various industries. This dynamic team is actively building LifeHUB Studios into a
                        compelling and convenient
                        destination to access and manage wellness solutions.</p>

                        <p>“Many of our interested audiences are looking for an easy tool to access their personal
                            wellness
                            options, a
                            platform that helps individuals take more control over personal healthcare options, a
                            solution
                            that goes far
                            beyond physical fitness tracking into education, cultural and life pursuits that add to
                            mental
                            wellness and
                            overall well-being.
                            LifeHUB is that platform. We`ve created a boundary-less space via the LifeHUB app that is an
                            inclusive
                            community gathering point for wellness interaction - physical, social, mental, creative,
                            educational -
                            literally any wellness pursuit that the LifeHUB community wants to explore.”</p>
